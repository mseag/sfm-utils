# sfm-utils
Utilities to parse text files (e.g. from Toolbox) and migrate SFM markers into a format suitable for Paratext.
Each book input is written to individual .sfm files.

Assumptions:
* Each text file is for a single chapter of a book
* Each directory of files is for a single book
* Text filenames consist of a bookname separated by space/underscore with the chapter number (e.g. Judges_19...txt)

## Usage
Note for developers: Replace `sfm-utils.exe` references with `node dist/index.js`.

Command-line
```bash
Usage: sfm-utils.exe -p p_arg [-t t_arg | -d d_arg | -j j_arg | -s s_arg]
```

Parameters
```bash
    Required
    -p [Paratext project name (can be 3-character abbreviation)]

    Optional - one of:
    -t [A single Toolbox text file (one chapter of a book)]
    -d [Directory of Toolbox text files for a single book (one chapter per file)]
    -j [JSON file representing a single book - used for testing conversion to SFM]
    -s [Directory of directories (each subdirectory is a separate book)]
```

### Help
Obtaining the sfm-utils version:
```bash
sfm-utils.exe --version
```

For additional help:
```bash
sfm-utils.exe -h
```

## Developer Setup
These utilities require Git, Node.js, and TypeScript (installed locally).

### Install Git
Download and install Git

https://git-scm.com/downloads

### Install Node.js and Dependencies
Download and install the latest current version for Node.js (>=18.12.0)

https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/

After installing Node.js, reboot your PC, open Git Bash to this directory and install this project's dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

This will install [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) locally and can be accessed with

```bash
npx tsc
```

### Compiling sfm-utils
This compiles the TypeScript source files in `src/` into Javascript (`dist/`)

To rebuild the project
```bash
npm run build
```

You can also have TypeScript watch the project and recompile automatically
```bash
npm run watch
```

### Debugging with Visual Studio Code
Open Folder as a VS Code Project

Edit your applicable parameters in [launch.json](./.vscode/launch.json). If using Windows paths, you'll need to escape the slashes (e.g. `-j "C:\\somewhere\\to\\text-or-json-files"`)

### Publishing sfm-utils.exe
This optional step creates a standalone Windows executable `sfm-utils.exe` so it can be run without Node.js. Published artifacts will be in the `deploy/` directory.

```bash
npm run publish
```

## Unit Tests (TODO)
Unit tests are run with the [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) test runner.
Remember to build sfm-utils before running tests. 
Terminal output best viewed in VS Code.
```bash
npm run test
```
